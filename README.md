# About Me

## Before GA:
I was working as a field engineer and supervisor for a large oil and gas services company. I worked with a large number of teams of engineers, supervisors, and rig personnel to complete multi-million dollar drilling projects. My job was to work with the drilling and geology teams to maintain the wellpath within the geological target zone while completing the project as quickly and safely as possible. It was pretty neat stuff. The technical work mostly consisted of making predictions using some trigonometry formula. I also utilized and maintained a large local data server containing detailed data about the drilling project. 

In the oil field, we work 12 hour shifts (and often times longer). A lot of this time is spent solving the current problems or optimizing our processes. However, there are some operations that didn't require my support which results in free time for me. After catching up on paperwork and double checking the plans for the next phase of the project, most engineers spend their free time taking naps and watching movies. Not me. I spent this time learning to code. I wrote custom python scripts to interact with our database and generate daily reports. I solved fun daily challenges on codewars and reddit’s r/dailyprogrammer with javascript. I learned some html and css to see and manipulate my solutions visually. I built fun apps for myself in native android and react-native.

Eventually, after six years, the month-long trips to the field began to wear on me and I began seeking other job options. I interviewed for engineering and project management positions that I had trouble getting excited about.

I began to think about what it might take to work full time in web or mobile development. I knew I had a long way to go at my current self taught pace to become competitive in Denver’s job market. The idea of a bootcamp was attractive because it could guide me in the rapid advancement of both my technical and soft skills. I had heard mixed opinions of bootcamps and some friends in the industry said they felt a self-taught candidate was more desirable than one who had gone to school. I knew it would be risky and challenging but in the end I came to the conclusion that the quickest way to meet my goal would be through a bootcamp.

## Outcomes support I need:
* Resume building
* Personal Branding / website & professional portfolio
* LinkedIn
* Networking events / connections

* Continued learning

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Get a job in Denver as a web developer
2. Meet unique and inspiring people with interesting passions and ideas in the tech industry
3. Learn the technical and soft skills to develop products that I and the people I work with are passionate about

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I want to work wherever will challenge me the most and give me the most opportunities for growth and learning. Agency work is attractive to get a lot of diverse experience quickly. I would like product work most if it was a product or tech I was excited about and I team I enjoyed working with.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
Currently I enjoy frontend and have several years of experience teaching myself frontend tools. I am excited to get some experience in backend because I think I will like that a lot.
